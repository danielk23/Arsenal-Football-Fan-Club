                    <p>By the end of the 1912/13 season, Arsenal's finances were in a parlous state. Henry Norris, who had recently taken charge, drew a stark conclusion: if Arsenal were to become a powerhouse in English football, they would have to move.</p>
                    <p>Highbury, north of the River Thames, would mean close proximity to another club - Tottenham - something Norris wanted to avoid. But the nearby underground station would increase the Club's chances of attracting large crowds and made Highbury a compelling option.</p>

                    <p>Allison, decided to retire after that campaign. His assistant, Tom Whittaker, took up the reigns and had an immediate effect for the 1947 season by winning the League by seven points from Manchester United.</p>
